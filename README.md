# Mitra Realty - Unit Stock Monitoring & Approval System

An internal web application designed for Mitra Realty to monitor and manage property unit inventory in real-time. This system introduces a crucial multi-level approval workflow to ensure data integrity and prevent common issues like double-bookings.

The application was developed to move away from error-prone manual tracking (like spreadsheets) and to provide a single source of truth for the sales, marketing, and management teams regarding unit availability.
